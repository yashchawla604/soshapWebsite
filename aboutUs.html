                S.O.S.H.A.P. stands for Stop Overthinking Spread Happiness And Positivity.<br>
                Nowadays, almost half of the population is dealing with depression, stress and anger issues.<br>
                One day , sitting on the chair having my green tea, I was studying psychology and psychodynamic<br>
                psychotherapy. Then this idea came in my mind. Basically, the idea behind this is to spread happiness<br> 
                and positive vibes. Some people feel difficult to express their emotions while others are extroverts.<br>
                People face difficulties due to over thinking and stressful life. I am trying to help those people.<br> 
                There is also page named “Soshap” on Instagram which is always open for the ones who want any<br> psychological
                help. I am always available to talk , listen and help you.
                It is small initiative to make this world<br> free of depression and anxiety.
